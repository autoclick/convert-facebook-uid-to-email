Pinterest is a popular social media platform that allows users to discover and save ideas, recipes, fashion inspiration, and more. One feature that makes Pinterest so convenient and user-friendly is the ability to quickly save content from any website using a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that can be saved as a bookmark in your browser's toolbar, allowing you to perform specific actions on webpages with a single click.

In this article, we will guide you through the process of making a Pinterest bookmarklet, which will enable you to save images and articles to your Pinterest boards with ease. Whether you are an avid pinner or just getting started on Pinterest, this bookmarklet will be a valuable tool in your browsing experience.

## Step 1: Go to the Pinterest Goodies Page

To begin, open your web browser and navigate to the Pinterest Goodies page. You can simply search for "Pinterest Goodies" in your preferred search engine and click on the first result. The Goodies page is a collection of Pinterest tools and features that enhance your Pinterest experience.

## Step 2: Drag the "Pin It" Button to Your Browser Toolbar

On the Goodies page, you will find various Pinterest tools and widgets. Look for the "Pin It" button, which is specifically designed for bookmarklet functionality. It is usually located towards the top of the page.

Click and hold the left mouse button on the "Pin It" button and drag it to your browser's toolbar. In most web browsers, the toolbar is located below the address bar. Once you see the outline of the button in your toolbar, release the mouse button to drop the bookmarklet.

## Step 3: Drop the "Pin It" Button onto Your Favorites or Bookmarks Bar

After dropping the "Pin It" button onto your browser toolbar, you will be prompted to choose a location for the bookmarklet. You can either drop it onto your Favorites bar or Bookmarks bar, depending on your browser.

If you are using Google Chrome, you will see the option to drop the bookmarklet onto the Bookmarks bar. If you are using Firefox or Internet Explorer, you will be able to drop it onto either the Bookmarks bar or Favorites bar. Choose the appropriate option that suits your preferences.

Once you have dropped the "Pin It" button onto your toolbar or bar, a prompt will appear asking for your confirmation to install the bookmarklet. Click on the "Add" or "Install" button to complete the installation process. The exact wording may vary depending on your browser.

After confirming the installation, the Pinterest bookmarklet is ready to use. You can now easily save images and articles to your Pinterest boards while browsing the web.
