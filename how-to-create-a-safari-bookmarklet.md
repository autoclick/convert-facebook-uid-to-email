A bookmarklet is a small piece of code that can be saved as a bookmark in your web browser. When clicked, the bookmarklet executes the code and performs a specific task or function. In Safari, creating a bookmarklet is a simple process that allows you to customize your browsing experience and add extra functionality to your browser. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps of creating a Safari bookmarklet.

## Step 1: Open Safari and Enable the Favorites Bar

Before you can create a bookmarklet, you need to make sure that the Favorites Bar is enabled in Safari. The Favorites Bar is a toolbar located below the address bar that provides quick access to your bookmarks.

To enable the Favorites Bar, open Safari and go to Safari > View > Show Favorites Bar. This will make sure that the toolbar is visible and accessible for adding your bookmarklet.

## Step 2: Create a New Bookmark

To create a new bookmark, go to the website or web page that you want to create a bookmarklet for. Once you are on the desired page, click on the "Share" icon in Safari's toolbar. It is represented by a square with an upward-pointing arrow.

In the Share menu, click on "Add Bookmark". A new window will appear where you can customize your bookmark.

## Step 3: Edit the Bookmark

In the bookmark window, you can edit the bookmark title and choose where you want to save it. By default, the bookmark will be saved in the Favorites folder.

To create a bookmarklet, you need to edit the URL field of the bookmark. Instead of specifying a website URL, you will enter the Javascript code that you want to execute when the bookmarklet is clicked.

## Step 4: Adding the Javascript Code

## To add the Javascript code to the bookmarklet, you have a few options:

## Option 1: Manually Enter the Code

If you know the Javascript code that you want to use, you can manually enter it into the URL field of the bookmark. Make sure that you enclose the code with the following format:

## \`javascript:code\`

For example, if you want to create a bookmarklet that opens a new tab with a specific website, the Javascript code would be:

## \`javascript:window.open("https://www.example.com")\`

## Option 2: Copying the Code from a Website

If you don't have Javascript coding experience, you can find pre-made bookmarklets online that you can simply copy and paste into the URL field of the bookmark.

There are many websites that provide a list of bookmarklets and their corresponding code. Some popular bookmarklet websites include Bookmarklet.com and FreeCodeCamp.org.

## Step 5: Save the Bookmarklet

Once you have added the Javascript code to the URL field of the bookmark, click "Add" to save the bookmarklet. It will now appear in your Safari bookmark list.

## Step 6: Using the Bookmarklet

To use the bookmarklet, simply click on the bookmark in your Safari bookmark list or click on the bookmarklet in the Favorites Bar. The Javascript code will be executed, and the desired action or function will be performed.

## Tips for Creating Safari Bookmarklets:

Here are some handy tips and best practices to keep in mind when creating Safari bookmarklets:

1\. Test the bookmarklet: Before you start using the bookmarklet regularly, make sure to test it to ensure that it performs the desired action correctly.

2\. Keep the code concise: Bookmarklets are meant to be small and lightweight. Try to keep the code as short and concise as possible to ensure fast and efficient execution.

3\. Use bookmarklet generators: If you struggle with writing Javascript code, you can use online bookmarklet generators that provide a user-friendly interface for creating bookmarklets.

4\. Backup your bookmarks: It's a good idea to back up your bookmarks periodically, especially if you have a lot of bookmarklets. This way, you can easily restore them if they get lost or accidentally deleted.

## Conclusion

Creating a Safari bookmarklet allows you to customize your browsing experience and add extra functionality to your browser. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily create your own bookmarklets and enhance your Safari web browsing experience. So go ahead and start experimenting with bookmarklets to streamline your daily tasks and make your browsing experience more efficient and personalized.
