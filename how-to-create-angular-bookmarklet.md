Creating an Angular bookmarklet can be a powerful tool to enhance your browsing experience and streamline your workflow. A bookmarklet is a bookmark that contains JavaScript code instead of a regular URL, allowing you to execute custom actions on any webpage with just a click. In this article, we will explore how to create an Angular bookmarklet step by step.

## What is an Angular Bookmarklet?

Angular is a popular JavaScript framework for building web applications. By leveraging Angular in a bookmarklet, we can create interactive and dynamic features that can be executed on any webpage. This opens up a world of possibilities, from modifying the appearance of a website to extracting or manipulating content.

## Step 1: Setup Angular Project

To create an Angular bookmarklet, we first need to set up an Angular project. If you already have an existing Angular project, you can skip this step.

## 1\. Open your terminal or command prompt.

## 2\. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.

## 3\. Run the following command to create a new Angular project:

## \`\`\`

## ng new angular-bookmarklet

## \`\`\`

## 4\. Enter the project directory by running the command:

## \`\`\`

## cd angular-bookmarklet

## \`\`\`

## Step 2: Create Angular Component

In this step, we will create a new Angular component that will contain the logic for our bookmarklet.

## 1\. Run the following command to generate a new component:

## \`\`\`

## ng generate component bookmarklet

## \`\`\`

2\. Open the \`bookmarklet.component.ts\` file located in the \`src/app/bookmarklet\` directory. Add your custom logic to the component. This can include modifying the webpage's elements, extracting data, or interacting with external APIs.

Here is an example of a simple Angular bookmarklet component that changes the background color of the webpage:

## \`\`\`typescript

## import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

## @Component({

## selector: 'app-bookmarklet',

## template: '',

## })

## export class BookmarkletComponent implements OnInit {

## ngOnInit(): void {

## document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'red';

## }

## }

## \`\`\`

## Step 3: Build the Angular Project

Once you have defined your Angular component, you need to build the project. This will compile the code and create the necessary files for your bookmarklet.

## 1\. Open your terminal or command prompt.

## 2\. Navigate to the root directory of your Angular project.

## 3\. Run the following command to build the project:

## \`\`\`

## ng build --prod

## \`\`\`

This command will generate a \`dist\` folder in your project directory, which contains the compiled code.

## Step 4: Convert Angular Build to Bookmarklet

Now that we have our Angular project compiled, we can convert it into a bookmarklet that can be executed in any browser.

## 1\. Open a text editor or a code editor of your choice.

2\. Create a new file and give it a meaningful name, such as \`angular-bookmarklet.js\`.

## 3\. Copy and paste the following code into the file:

## \`\`\`javascript

## javascript:(function(){

## var script = document.createElement('script');

## script.src = 'path-to-your-dist-folder/main.js';

## script.onload = function() {

## var app = document.createElement('app-root');

## document.body.appendChild(app);

## };

## document.body.appendChild(script);

## })()

## \`\`\`

4\. Replace \`'path-to-your-dist-folder/main.js'\` with the relative path to the \`main.js\` file generated in the \`dist\` folder of your Angular project. It should look something like \`'./dist/angular-bookmarklet/main.js'\`.

## Step 5: Add the Bookmarklet to your Browser

To use the Angular bookmarklet in your browser, you need to add it as a bookmark.

## 1\. Open your browser and create a new bookmark.

2\. Paste the content of the \`angular-bookmarklet.js\` file into the URL field of the bookmark. 3. Give the bookmark a descriptive name, such as "Angular Bookmarklet".

## 4\. Save the bookmark.

## Step 6: Test the Bookmarklet

Now that you have added the Angular bookmarklet to your browser, it's time to test it on a webpage.

## 1\. Open any webpage in your browser.

## 2\. Click on the bookmark you created.

3\. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the effects of your Angular bookmarklet applied to the webpage.

## Conclusion

Creating an Angular bookmarklet can be a powerful tool for enhancing your browsing experience and adding custom features to any webpage. By following these steps, you can leverage the power of Angular to create dynamic and interactive bookmarklets. Whether you want to modify a website's appearance or extract and manipulate content on the fly, Angular bookmarklets can help streamline your workflow and make browsing the web more efficient. So go ahead and start experimenting with your own Angular bookmarklets today.
