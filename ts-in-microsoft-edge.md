If you're a macOS user and want to add bookmarklets to Microsoft Edge, you may be frustrated to find that the traditional methods of adding bookmarklets don't work in this browser. Bookmarklets are usually added by dragging them from a web page to the Favorites bar, but Edge doesn't allow this. However, there is still a way to manually add and use bookmarklets in Microsoft Edge on macOS.

In this article, we will guide you through the steps to add bookmarklets to Microsoft Edge on macOS and explain why Edge doesn't allow them by default. We will also discuss how to use bookmarklets in other browsers and provide some popular and useful bookmarklets you can try.

## So let's get started!

## Why Doesn't Edge Allow Bookmarklets by Default?

Microsoft Edge is built on a different rendering engine called Chromium, which is also used by Google Chrome. Unlike older versions of Edge, which used a different engine, Chromium-based Edge does not support direct dragging and dropping of bookmarklets into the Favorites bar.

This change is due to security reasons. Dragging and dropping bookmarklets directly from a web page can potentially execute harmful JavaScript code, which can compromise the security of the browser and the user's system. As a result, Microsoft has disabled this functionality in Edge to ensure a safer browsing experience.

Although Microsoft Edge doesn't allow direct dragging and dropping of bookmarklets, you can still manually add them to your Favorites bar using a few alternative methods.

## Manually Adding Bookmarklets to Edge on macOS

To manually add a bookmarklet to Microsoft Edge on macOS, follow the step-by-step instructions below:

## 1\. Open Microsoft Edge on your macOS device.

## 2\. Go to the website where the bookmarklet is located.

3\. Right-click on the address bar and select "Copy" to copy the URL of the current page. 4. Right-click on the Favorites bar (if it isn't visible, right-click on the empty space below the address bar and select "Show Favorites bar") and choose "Add Folder" to create a new folder for your bookmarklets (optional). 5. Right-click on the newly created folder (or the Favorites bar if you didn't create a folder) and select "Add to favorites."

## 6\. In the "Name" field, enter a descriptive name for the bookmarklet.

## 7\. In the "URL" field, paste the URL that you copied in step 3.

## 8\. Click "Save" to add the bookmarklet to your Favorites bar.

Once you've added the bookmarklet, you can access it by clicking on the Favorites bar and selecting the bookmarklet from the list.

## Using Bookmarklets in Other Browsers

If you're using a browser other than Microsoft Edge, you can also add and use bookmarklets. Here are the steps for popular browsers:

## Google Chrome:

1\. Open Chrome and go to the web page where the bookmarklet is located. 2. Drag and drop the bookmarklet to your Bookmarks bar. The bookmarklet will be saved as a bookmark. 3. To use the bookmarklet, simply click on it from your Bookmarks bar when you're on a web page where you want to use it.

## Mozilla Firefox:

1\. Open Firefox and go to the web page where the bookmarklet is located.

## 2\. Right-click on the bookmarklet and select "Bookmark This Link."

3\. Choose the folder where you want to save the bookmarklet and click "Save." 4. To use the bookmarklet, click on the "Bookmarks" menu, locate the bookmarklet, and select it from the list when you're on a web page where you want to use it.

## Safari:

1\. Open Safari and go to the web page where the bookmarklet is located.

## 2\. Drag and drop the bookmarklet to your Favorites bar.

3\. To use the bookmarklet, simply click on it from your Favorites bar when you're on a web page where you want to use it.

## Popular and Useful Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets can be incredibly useful, allowing you to perform various tasks and automate actions on websites. Here are a few popular and handy bookmarklets that you can try:
