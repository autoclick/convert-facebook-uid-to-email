Bookmarklets are an incredibly useful tool for enhancing your browsing experience on the web. They are essentially bookmarks that contain a piece of JavaScript code that can be executed on any webpage you visit. With bookmarklets, you can automate tasks, modify the appearance of a website, or extract information, among other things.

In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing and using bookmarklets on a Mac computer. Whether you want to save articles for later reading, share content on social media, or simplify a repetitive task, bookmarklets can greatly enhance your productivity.
