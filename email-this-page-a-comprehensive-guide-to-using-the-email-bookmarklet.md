## Introduction

In today's digital age, email has become an essential means of communication. We use email for various purposes, including sending important documents, sharing information, and even saving web pages for future reference. However, the process of emailing a web page to ourselves can often be cumbersome and time-consuming. That's where the Email Bookmarklet comes in.

## What is an Email Bookmarklet?

An Email Bookmarklet is a browser bookmark that allows you to quickly and easily email a web page to yourself. It eliminates the need to copy and paste the URL or use the browser's built-in email function. Instead, with just a single click, the bookmarklet will automatically compose a new email with the web page's URL and other essential field pre-populated. All you have to do is hit send and wait for the email to arrive in your inbox.

## Setting up the Email Bookmarklet

Setting up the Email Bookmarklet is a simple process that can be done in a few easy steps.

## Step 1: Open the Bookmarklet Page

Start by visiting the webpage that provides the Email Bookmarklet. For example, the website labnol.org offers an Email Bookmarklet that you can use.

## Step 2: Drag the Bookmarklet to your Bookmarks Toolbar

Once you are on the webpage, locate the Email Bookmarklet. It is usually represented by a button or icon with the label "Email This Page!" or something similar. Click and hold the bookmarklet, then drag it to your browser's bookmarks toolbar. Release the button when the bookmarklet is in the desired position on the toolbar.

## Step 3: Use the Bookmarklet

To use the Email Bookmarklet, navigate to the web page that you want to email to yourself. Once you are on the desired page, simply click on the Email Bookmarklet button in your bookmarks toolbar. The browser will then open your default email client with a new message that includes the URL of the web page.

## Step 4: Send the Email

Review the email message, make any necessary edits or additions, and then click the send button to email the web page to yourself. Depending on your email client settings, the email may arrive almost instantly or may take a few moments to appear in your inbox.

## Customizing the Email Bookmarklet

While the default behavior of the Email Bookmarklet is to include the URL of the web page in the email, you can customize it to suit your preferences. For example, you may want to add a subject line or include a brief description of the web page in the email body.

To customize the Email Bookmarklet, you will need to edit the JavaScript code of the bookmarklet. This may require some basic understanding of JavaScript coding, but it can be easily done with a little guidance.

## Step 1: Locate the JavaScript Code

Find the JavaScript code for the Email Bookmarklet by right-clicking on the bookmarklet button in your browser's bookmarks toolbar. Select the "Edit" or "Properties" option, and a dialog box will appear displaying the JavaScript code.

## Step 2: Edit the JavaScript Code

Within the JavaScript code, you can modify different aspects of the bookmarklet to customize its behavior. For example, you can add variables for the email subject and body, or change the default email recipient.

## Step 3: Save the Changes

After making the desired modifications to the JavaScript code, save the changes and close the dialogue box. The Email Bookmarklet will now use the updated code when clicked, reflecting your customization options.

## Managing Bookmarklets

Once you start using bookmarklets, you may accumulate several of them in your bookmarks toolbar. Managing these bookmarklets ensures that your toolbar is organized and clutter-free. Here are a few things you can do:

## 1\. Editing a Bookmarklet

To edit a bookmarklet, right-click on the bookmarklet button in your bookmarks toolbar and select the "Edit" or "Properties" option. This will open the dialogue box where you can modify the bookmarklet's JavaScript code and customize its behavior.

## 2\. Deleting a Bookmarklet

If you no longer have a need for a particular bookmarklet, you can delete it from your bookmarks toolbar. Right-click on the bookmarklet button and select the "Delete" or "Remove" option. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

## 3\. Sharing a Bookmarklet

Bookmarklets can be shared with others by providing the JavaScript code or a link to the bookmarklet page. This allows your friends, colleagues, or online communities to benefit from the functionality of the bookmarklet.

## Popular Bookmarklets and Use Cases

Bookmarklets offer a wide range of functionalities that can enhance your browsing experience. Here are a few popular bookmarklets and their use cases:
