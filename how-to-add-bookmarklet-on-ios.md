Bookmarklets are small pieces of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks in your browser. They allow you to perform various actions on webpages with a single click. While adding a bookmarklet on iOS may not be as straightforward as on other platforms, it is still possible with a few simple steps. In this article, we'll guide you on how to add bookmarklets on iOS.

Before we start, it's important to note that this method requires the use of a Mac with Safari or iCloud. Unfortunately, there is no direct method to add bookmarklets on iOS without using a Mac. With that said, let's get started.

## Step 1: Install iCloud on your Mac and iOS Device

First, ensure that iCloud is installed and set up on both your Mac and iOS device. This will allow your bookmarks to sync seamlessly between the two devices.

## Step 2: Create a Bookmarklet on Your Mac

To add a bookmarklet on iOS, you first need to create it on your Mac. Open Safari on your Mac and browse to a webpage that provides the bookmarklet you want to install. Once you have found the bookmarklet, select and copy the entire JavaScript code to your clipboard.

## Step 3: Add the Bookmarklet to Your Bookmarks Bar on Mac

In Safari, go to the bookmarks bar and right-click on it. Select "Add Bookmark" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can press Command + D on your keyboard. Give your bookmarklet a name and paste the JavaScript code into the URL field. Make sure to remove any spaces or line breaks from the code to ensure it works properly.

## Step 4: Sync Bookmarks using iCloud

Ensure that Safari is open on both your Mac and iOS device. Wait for a few moments to allow the bookmarks to sync between the two devices using iCloud.

## Step 5: Access Bookmarks on Your iOS Device

On your iOS device, open Safari and tap on the bookmark icon at the bottom of the screen. At the top of the bookmark screen, you will see a list of folders. Look for the "Bookmarks Bar" folder and tap on it. You should see the bookmarklet you created on your Mac in this folder.

## Step 6: Use the Bookmarklet on iOS

To use the bookmarklet, simply tap on it from the "Bookmarks Bar" folder. The JavaScript code will execute, and the desired action will be performed on the current webpage.

## Alternative Methods

While the method described above is the most reliable and seamless way to add bookmarklets on iOS, there are a few alternative methods you can try if you don't have access to a Mac or iCloud.

1\. Use a Third-Party App: Some third-party apps, such as Workflow or Drafts, allow you to create and run custom bookmarklets on iOS. These apps provide a platform to automate tasks and can be used to create bookmarklets for various actions. However, this method may require a bit more technical knowledge and setup.

2\. Manually Add JavaScript Code: If you're familiar with coding and JavaScript, you can manually add the bookmarklet's JavaScript code to a new bookmark on your iOS device. To do this, create a regular bookmark in Safari on your iOS device. Edit the bookmark's URL and replace it with the JavaScript code of the bookmarklet. This method may require some trial and error to ensure the code is properly formatted.

## Conclusion

While iOS does not provide a direct method to add bookmarklets, using a Mac and iCloud allows you to sync bookmarklets seamlessly between your devices. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily add bookmarklets to Safari on iOS and take advantage of their functionality.
