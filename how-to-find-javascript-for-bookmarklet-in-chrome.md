Creating a javascript bookmarklet can be a powerful tool for automating tasks and enhancing your browsing experience in Google Chrome. Bookmarklets are bookmarks that execute javascript code instead of opening a webpage, allowing you to perform specific actions on a page with just a click of a button. In this article, we will discuss how to find javascript for bookmarklets in Chrome and provide some useful resources for further learning.

## 1\. Enabling the Bookmark Bar:

Before we start creating bookmarklets, it's important to ensure that the bookmark bar is enabled in Google Chrome. To do this, simply press CTRL-SHIFT-B, and the bookmark bar will appear if it was previously hidden. This will provide you with easy access to your bookmarklets.

## 2\. Accessing Chrome's Bookmark Manager:

To create and manage your bookmarklets in Google Chrome, you will need to access Chrome's Bookmark Manager. Right-click on the bookmark bar and select "Bookmark Manager" from the context menu. This will open a new tab with the Bookmark Manager interface.

## 3\. Adding a New Bookmark:

Once you are in the Bookmark Manager, you can begin adding a new bookmarklet. Right-click within the Bookmark Manager interface and choose "Add new bookmark" from the context menu. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the details for your bookmarklet.

## 4\. Naming the Bookmarklet:

In the dialog box, you will need to give your bookmarklet a name. Choose a name that will help you identify the function or action that the bookmarklet will perform. This name will be displayed on the bookmark bar, so make sure it is descriptive enough for you to understand its purpose.

## 5\. Pasting the Javascript Code:

Next, you will need to enter the javascript code for your bookmarklet in the URL field of the dialog box. The code should start with "javascript:" followed by the javascript function or code that you want the bookmarklet to execute. You can either write the code directly or copy and paste it from another source.

## 6\. Saving the Bookmarklet:

After pasting the javascript code, click the "Save" button to save the bookmarklet. It will now appear on your bookmark bar, ready to be used whenever you need it. You can click on the bookmarklet to execute the javascript code on the current page.

## 7\. Using External JS Files:

Instead of directly writing javascript code in the URL field, you can also use a bookmarklet that creates a script tag with a reference to an external javascript file. This allows you to separate the javascript code from the bookmarklet and easily update it when necessary. To do this, use the following format in the URL field:

## javascript:(function(){

## var script = document.createElement('script');

## script.src = 'path/to/your\_script.js';

## document.body.appendChild(script);

## })();

Once you have created your bookmarklet, you can use it by simply clicking on it in the bookmark bar while viewing any webpage. The bookmarklet will execute the javascript code on the current page, allowing you to perform various actions or modifications.
