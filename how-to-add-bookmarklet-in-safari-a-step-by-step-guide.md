## Introduction

Bookmarklets are a convenient way to enhance your browsing experience by adding functionality to your web browser. They are small pieces of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks and executed with a single click. While they can be used in different web browsers, this article will focus on adding bookmarklets in Safari, specifically on iOS devices. Let's dive into the step-by-step guide on how to add bookmarklets in Safari!

## Step 1: Create a Regular Bookmark

The first step is to create a regular bookmark, just like you would for any other website. This bookmark will serve as a placeholder for the bookmarklet you will add later. Here's how you can create a regular bookmark in Safari:

## 1\. Open Safari on your iOS device.

## 2\. Navigate to any webpage.

3\. Tap the share button, which is represented by a box with an upward-pointing arrow.

## 4\. In the share sheet that appears, select "Add Bookmark".

5\. You can edit the bookmark name and choose the location where you want to save it, such as the bookmarks bar or a folder.

## 6\. Finally, tap "Save" to create the bookmark.

## Step 2: Copy the JavaScript Code

To add a bookmarklet, you need to obtain the JavaScript code for the desired functionality. Many websites and services provide bookmarklet codes for features like saving articles to read later, translating web pages, or sharing content on social media. Here's how you can copy the JavaScript code:

1\. Open the website or service that offers the bookmarklet functionality. 2. Look for instructions on how to obtain the bookmarklet and copy its JavaScript code. 3. Usually, you can find a button or link labeled "Get Bookmarklet" or "Get the Code". Click on it, and the JavaScript code will be displayed. 4. Tap and hold on the code to bring up the contextual menu, then select "Copy" to copy the code to your clipboard.

## Step 3: Edit the Bookmark

Now that you have the JavaScript code copied, you can edit the bookmark you created earlier to add the functionality of the bookmarklet. Here's how you can edit the bookmark:

1\. Tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the Safari screen (it looks like an open book). 2. Navigate to the location where you saved the regular bookmark created in Step 1.

## 3\. Tap the "Edit" button to start editing the bookmark.

## 4\. Select the bookmark you want to edit from the list.

5\. Modify the bookmark name to something that describes the bookmarklet's functionality.

## 6\. Tap on the URL field and delete the existing URL.

7\. Paste the previously copied JavaScript code into the URL field by tapping and holding the field, then selecting "Paste". 8. Make sure the prefix "javascript:" is present at the beginning of the code. If it's not, add it manually.

## 9\. Tap "Done" to save the changes.

## Step 4: Use the Bookmarklet

Now that the bookmark with the bookmarklet code is created, you can utilize its functionality whenever you want. Here's how you can use the bookmarklet in Safari:

## 1\. Open Safari on your iOS device.

## 2\. Navigate to any webpage.

## 3\. Tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the Safari screen.

## 4\. Navigate to the location where you saved the bookmarklet.

5\. Tap on the bookmarklet to execute the JavaScript code and apply its functionality to the current webpage.

## Conclusion

Adding a bookmarklet to Safari on your iOS device can greatly enhance your browsing experience by providing useful features at your fingertips.
