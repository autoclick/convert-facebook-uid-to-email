## Introduction

Pinterest is a popular social media platform that allows users to discover and save ideas for various interests, such as recipes, home decor, fashion, and much more. One of the easiest ways to save ideas from the web to your Pinterest boards is by using the Pinterest bookmarklet. In this guide, we will take you through the process of installing the Pinterest bookmarklet on your browser, making it effortless to pin any content you come across while browsing the internet.

## What is a bookmarklet?

A bookmarklet is a small piece of code that can be saved as a bookmark in your browser. When clicked, the bookmarklet executes specific functions or actions on the current webpage. In the case of Pinterest, the bookmarklet allows you to save images and videos directly from a webpage to your Pinterest boards with just a click.

## Step 1: Visit the Pinterest Goodies page

To get started, open your web browser and visit the Pinterest Goodies page. This page provides various tools and features that enhance your Pinterest experience, including the bookmarklet.

## Step 2: Drag the "Pin It" button to your browser toolbar

On the Pinterest Goodies page, locate the section that says "Pin It Button for Web Browsers" or something similar. You should see a button labeled "Pin It." Click and hold the left mouse button on the "Pin It" button, then drag it to your browser toolbar.

## Step 3: Drop the "Pin It" button onto your Favorites or Bookmarks bar

Release the left mouse button to drop the "Pin It" button onto your Favorites or Bookmarks bar. You should now see the "Pin It" button as a new bookmark on your browser toolbar.

## Step 4: Follow the prompts to complete the installation

To complete the installation of the Pinterest bookmarklet, click on the "Pin It" button on your bookmarks toolbar. You may be prompted to confirm the installation, depending on your browser. Follow the on-screen prompts to finish the setup.

## Step 5: Start using the Pinterest bookmarklet

Once the installation is complete, you can start using the Pinterest bookmarklet to save content from webpages to your Pinterest boards. Here's how:

## 1\. Find a webpage with images or videos you want to save to Pinterest.

## 2\. Click on the "Pin It" bookmarklet on your browser toolbar.

3\. A window will pop up, displaying all the images and videos available on the webpage. Select the image or video you want to save.

4\. You can choose the board to which you want to save the pin, add a description, and select tags. Click on the "Save" button to finalize the pinning process.

That's it! You have successfully installed and activated the Pinterest bookmarklet on your browser.

## Alternative Methods and Tips

In addition to the bookmarklet, Pinterest offers other tools that allow you to save ideas from the web. Here are some alternative methods and additional tips you can try:

1\. Pinterest Save Button: Pinterest also provides a browser extension called the "Pinterest Save Button" that you can install for easier pinning. Visit the Chrome Web Store or the browser extensions/add-ons section of your preferred browser, search for "Pinterest Save Button," and follow the installation instructions.

2\. Mobile Devices: If you want to install the Pinterest bookmarklet on a mobile device, such as an iPhone or iPad, you can add Pinterest as a favorite app by tapping the "Share" button, selecting "More," then "Edit," and finally, tapping the "+ Pinterest" option to add it to your sharing options.

3\. Syncing: If you use Pinterest across multiple devices, make sure to sync your bookmarks or favorites across those devices to have access to the Pinterest bookmarklet everywhere you go. This way, you can seamlessly pin content from any device.

4\. Customizing Your Pinboards: Pinterest allows you to customize your pinboards to reflect your interests and personality.
