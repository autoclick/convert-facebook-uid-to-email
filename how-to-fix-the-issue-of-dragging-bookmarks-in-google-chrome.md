## Introduction

Bookmarks are an essential feature of web browsers that allow users to save and organize their favorite websites for easy access. However, sometimes users encounter issues where they are unable to drag and drop bookmarks in Google Chrome. This can be frustrating as it hinders the ability to rearrange bookmarks or create new bookmark folders. In this article, we will explore different methods to resolve the issue of bookmarks not being draggable in Google Chrome.

## Method 1: Reset Google Chrome Flags

Google Chrome flags are experimental settings that can affect the behavior of the browser. Resetting these flags to their default values might resolve the issue of bookmarks not being draggable. Follow these steps to reset Chrome flags:

## 1\. Open Google Chrome and type "chrome://flags" in the address bar.

## 2\. Press Enter to navigate to the Chrome flags page.

3\. Click on the "Reset all to default" button located at the top-right corner of the page.

## 4\. Restart Google Chrome and check if the issue persists.

## Method 2: Downgrade to an Older Version of Google Chrome

Sometimes, bugs or conflicts in the latest version of Google Chrome can prevent bookmarks from being draggable. Downgrading to an older version of the browser can help resolve this issue. Here's how you can downgrade Chrome:

## 1\. Uninstall the current version of Google Chrome from your computer.

2\. Visit a reliable software archive website and search for an older version of Chrome that is compatible with your operating system.

## 3\. Download the older version and install it on your computer.

4\. Restart your computer and open Google Chrome to check if the issue has been resolved.

Note: It is important to exercise caution when downloading and installing software from third-party websites. Ensure that you are downloading from a trusted source to avoid malware or security risks.

## Method 3: Switch to a Different Browser

If the issue of bookmarks not being draggable persists, you might consider switching to a different browser temporarily. There are several alternative browsers available, such as Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Safari. Import your bookmarks from Google Chrome to the alternative browser and use it as a workaround until the issue is resolved.

## Method 4: Remove Your Data and Sync It Again

Bookmarks in Google Chrome are often synced with your Google account. If there is a sync issue, it can prevent bookmarks from being draggable. To fix this, follow these steps:

1\. Open Google Chrome and click on the three-dot menu icon in the top-right corner. 2. Go to "Settings" and click on "Sync and Google services" in the sidebar.

## 3\. Under the "Sync" section, click on "Manage what you sync."

## 4\. Toggle off the "Bookmarks" option to disable syncing.

5\. Restart Google Chrome and go back to the "Sync and Google services" section in settings.

## 6\. Toggle on the "Bookmarks" option to enable syncing again.

## 7\. Restart Google Chrome and check if the bookmarks are now draggable.

## Method 5: Repair Google Chrome Installation

If none of the above methods work, the Chrome installation on your computer might be damaged, causing the issue. To repair it, follow these steps:

## 1\. Close Google Chrome completely.

## 2\. Press the "Windows key + R" to open the Run dialog box.

## 3\. Type "control" and press Enter to open the Control Panel.

4\. In the Control Panel, click on "Programs" or "Programs and Features."

## 5\. Locate Google Chrome in the list of installed programs.

## 6\. Right-click on Google Chrome and select "Uninstall" or "Change."

## 7\. Follow the prompts to uninstall Google Chrome.

8\. Once uninstalled, visit the official Google Chrome website and download the latest version.

## 10\. Open Google Chrome and check if the bookmarks are now draggable.

## Conclusion
