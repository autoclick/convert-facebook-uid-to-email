The bookmarklet tool in eBay is a useful feature that allows users to easily create links to eBay products and earn commissions as part of the eBay Partner Network. This tool can be used by anyone who is a member of the eBay Partner Network and wants to promote eBay products on their website, blog, or social media platforms. In this article, we will explore how to use the bookmarklet tool in eBay and provide step-by-step instructions on how to create and use bookmarklets.

To get started with the bookmarklet tool in eBay, you will first need to log into the eBay Partner Network portal at partner.ebay.com. Once logged in, you can access the bookmarklet tool by selecting it from the Tools drop-down menu.

When you open the bookmarklet tool, you will be able to select the campaign to which any links created with the bookmarklet should be attributed. This is important for tracking purposes and ensuring that you receive the appropriate commissions for your referrals.

Once you have selected the campaign, you can proceed to create a bookmarklet. A bookmarklet is a small piece of code that can be saved as a bookmark in your web browser. When activated, the bookmarklet will perform a specific action on the current page you are viewing.

## To create a bookmarklet in eBay, you will need to follow these steps:

1\. On the bookmarklet tool page, you will see a box labeled "Create your Bookmarklet." This box contains the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet.

2\. Select and copy the JavaScript code from the box. You can do this by highlighting the code and pressing Ctrl+C (or Command+C on a Mac).

3\. Open your web browser's bookmarks manager. The method for accessing the bookmarks manager may vary depending on the browser you are using. In most browsers, you can open the bookmarks manager by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (or Command+Shift+B on a Mac).

4\. Create a new bookmark. In the bookmarks manager, look for an option to add a new bookmark or create a new bookmark folder. Click on this option to open the bookmark creation dialog.

5\. In the bookmark creation dialog, enter a name for your bookmarklet. This can be anything you want, but it should be descriptive so you can easily identify it later.

6\. In the URL field of the bookmark creation dialog, paste the JavaScript code that you copied earlier. You can do this by clicking inside the URL field and pressing Ctrl+V (or Command+V on a Mac).

7\. Save the bookmark. Click the "Save" or "Done" button to save your bookmarklet. It will now appear in your bookmarks list.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a bookmarklet for the eBay Partner Network. Now, whenever you want to create a link to an eBay product, you can simply click on your bookmarklet, and it will automatically generate a tracking link for you. This tracking link includes your unique affiliate ID, allowing eBay to attribute any commissions to your account.

## To use the bookmarklet, you can follow these steps:

1\. Navigate to the eBay product page that you want to link to. This can be any product listed on eBay.

2\. Click on the bookmarklet that you created. This will activate the bookmarklet and generate a tracking link for the current page.

3\. Copy the generated tracking link. This is the link that you will use to promote the eBay product.

4\. Paste the tracking link wherever you want to promote the eBay product. This can be on your website, blog, social media posts, or anywhere else you have an online presence.

By using the bookmarklet tool in eBay, you can easily create tracking links for eBay products and earn commissions for any sales that result from your referrals. This is a powerful tool for monetizing your online content and leveraging the vast selection of products available on eBay.
