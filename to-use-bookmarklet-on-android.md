Bookmarklets are powerful tools that allow users to perform various actions on web pages with just a click. They are essentially bookmarks with embedded JavaScript code instead of a web address. When activated, the JavaScript code is executed, enabling users to interact with the webpage in unique and useful ways. While bookmarklets are commonly used on desktop browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox, they can also be utilized on mobile browsers, including Android.

However, using bookmarklets on Android does require specific steps and may not be as straightforward as on desktop browsers. In this article, we will guide you through the process of using bookmarklets on Android devices and explain how to add, run, delete, and share bookmarklets on mobile browsers.

## Finding Bookmarklets

To use bookmarklets on Android, you first need to find the bookmarklets you want to use. Bookmarklets can be created by yourself or obtained from various websites that offer collections of bookmarklets for different purposes, such as social media sharing, website analysis, or productivity tools.

Many popular websites, including Twitter, Facebook, and Pocket, provide bookmarklets on their respective sites. You can often find them in the help or support sections of these websites. Additionally, there are dedicated bookmarklet repositories where you can browse and search for bookmarklets based on specific functions or categories.

## Installing Bookmarklets on Android

Once you have found a bookmarklet you want to use, the next step is to install it on your Android device.

## 5\. Next, tap on "Add Bookmark" or "Add to Home Screen" to proceed.

6\. In the bookmark creation window, enter a name for the bookmarklet and remove the web address.
