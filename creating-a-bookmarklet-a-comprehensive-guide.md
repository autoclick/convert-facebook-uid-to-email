A bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that you can save as a bookmark in your browser. When you click on the bookmarklet, it runs the JavaScript code on the current webpage, allowing you to perform various actions or automate tasks.

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of creating and using a bookmarklet. We will also provide examples of common bookmarklets and explain how to edit them. Let's get started!

## Step 1: Write JavaScript Code

The first step in creating a bookmarklet is to write the JavaScript code that you want to run on a webpage. You can write this code using the JavaScript console in your browser's developer tools or use an online code editor such as JSFiddle or CodePen.

For example, let's say you want to highlight all the links on a webpage. You can use the following JavaScript code:

## \`\`\`javascript

## javascript:(function() {

## var links = document.querySelectorAll('a');

## links.forEach(function(link) {

## link.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';

## });

## })();

## \`\`\`

This code selects all the anchor (\`\`) elements on the page and changes their background color to yellow.

## Step 2: Add the JavaScript Protocol

To turn the JavaScript code into a bookmarklet, you need to add the \`javascript:\` protocol in front of the code. This tells the browser to interpret the code as JavaScript when the bookmarklet is clicked.

## \`\`\`javascript

## javascript:(function() {

## var links = document.querySelectorAll('a');

## links.forEach(function(link) {

## link.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';

## });

## })();

## \`\`\`

## Step 3: Wrap in an Anonymous Function

To prevent conflicts with the webpage's existing JavaScript code, it's best practice to wrap the entire bookmarklet code in an anonymous function. This isolates the code from the rest of the page and ensures it runs independently.

## \`\`\`javascript

## javascript:(function() {

## (function() {

## var links = document.querySelectorAll('a');

## links.forEach(function(link) {

## link.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';

## });

## })();

## })();

## \`\`\`

## Step 4: Create a Bookmark

Now that you have your bookmarklet code ready, it's time to create a bookmark in your browser. Right-click on the bookmarks bar or go to the bookmarks menu and select "Add Bookmark" or a similar option.

A bookmark form will appear, prompting you to enter a name for the bookmark and a URL. In the URL field, paste your bookmarklet code.

## Step 5: Save the Bookmark

After pasting the bookmarklet code in the URL field, give your bookmark a descriptive name. This name will be displayed on your bookmarks bar or menu, so choose something meaningful to easily identify its purpose.

Once you have named your bookmarklet, click the save button to add it to your browser's bookmarks.

## Step 6: Drag to the Bookmark Bar

To make your bookmarklet easily accessible, you can drag and drop it from the bookmarks menu to your bookmarks bar. This allows you to click on the bookmarklet directly from the bar without having to navigate through your bookmarks.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the bookmarklet and select "Add to bookmarks bar" or a similar option.

## Step 7: Use the Bookmarklet

Congratulations! You have successfully created a bookmarklet. To use it, simply open a webpage and click on the bookmarklet in your bookmarks bar.

In our example, when you click on the bookmarklet, it will highlight all the links on the page by changing their background color to yellow.

## Examples of Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets can be used to perform a wide range of actions on webpages. Here are a few examples:

1\. Readability: Simplify the layout of a webpage, making it easier to read.

## 2\. Translate: Automatically translate a webpage into another language.

## 3\. Tweet This: Share the current page on Twitter.

4\. Pocket: Save the current page to your Pocket account for reading later.

## 5\. Remove Ads: Remove all advertisements from the webpage.

6\. Toggle Dark Mode: Switch the webpage to a darker color scheme for better readability at night. 7. Copy Selection: Copy the selected text on the webpage to your clipboard.

These are just a few examples, but with some JavaScript knowledge, you can create your own bookmarklets to cater to your specific needs.

## How to Edit a Bookmarklet

To edit a bookmarklet, you'll need to access your browser's bookmark manager. This can usually be done by right-clicking on the bookmarks bar or using a keyboard shortcut, such as Ctrl + Shift + B.

In the bookmark manager, locate the bookmarklet you want to edit and right-click on it. Select the "Edit" or a similar option to bring up the bookmark editor.

In the bookmark editor, you can modify the name of the bookmarklet or update the JavaScript code in the URL field. Make the necessary changes and click the save button to save your edits.

## What is an IIFE?

In the code examples provided earlier, you may have noticed the use of an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression). An IIFE is a JavaScript design pattern that allows you to execute a function immediately after it is defined.

In the context of bookmarklets, wrapping your code in an IIFE isolates it from the global scope of the webpage. This prevents conflicts with existing JavaScript code on the page.

## The syntax for an IIFE is as follows:

## \`\`\`javascript

## (function() {

## // Your code here

## })();

## \`\`\`

The outer parentheses surrounding the function definition turn it into an expression, which can then be immediately invoked with the following parentheses.

## Conclusion

Bookmarklets are a powerful tool for automating tasks, enhancing webpages, and improving your browsing experience. With just a few lines of JavaScript code, you can create bookmarklets that perform various actions on any webpage.

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can easily create your own bookmarklets and customize them to suit your needs. Experiment with different JavaScript code snippets and explore the possibilities of bookmarklets to enhance your web browsing experience.
