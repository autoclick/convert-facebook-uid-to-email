## 1\. What are Bookmarklets?

Bookmarklets are snippets of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks in web browsers. Unlike traditional bookmarks, which simply save the URL of a website, bookmarklets allow for the execution of JavaScript code on the current web page. When clicked, the bookmarklet triggers the code, enabling users to perform specific actions or add custom functionality to the page. Bookmarklets are typically stored in the href attribute of an HTML anchor tag () and can be easily added, edited, and shared.

## 2\. How to Create a JavaScript Bookmarklet

Creating a JavaScript bookmarklet is straightforward. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Write the JavaScript code you want to execute.

## \- It should be a self-contained function or a one-liner.

## \- Make sure the code is tested and functioning correctly.

## Step 2: Encode the JavaScript code.

\- To ensure compatibility with different browsers, you need to encode the JavaScript code using the encodeURIComponent() function.

## \- You can use online tools or JavaScript functions for encoding.

## Step 3: Construct the bookmarklet URL.

\- Use the "javascript:" protocol followed by the encoded JavaScript code. - Example: \`[My Bookmarklet](${encodedCode};)\`.

## 3\. How to Add a Bookmarklet

Adding a bookmarklet to your browser is as simple as adding a regular bookmark. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create a bookmarklet HTML snippet.

\- Use the HTML code mentioned in the previous section to create a bookmarklet snippet.

## Step 2: Drag the bookmarklet HTML snippet to your bookmarks bar.

## \- Simply drag the snippet and drop it onto your bookmarks bar.

## 4\. How to Edit and Delete a Bookmarklet

Editing or deleting a bookmarklet is similar to editing or deleting a regular bookmark. Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open your browser's bookmark manager.

\- Locate the bookmark manager, usually found in the browser's settings or bookmarks menu.

## Step 2: Find the bookmarklet you want to edit or delete.

## \- Look for the bookmarklet based on its name or URL.

## Step 3: Edit or delete the bookmarklet.

\- To edit the bookmarklet, modify the URL, name, or any other relevant information. - To delete the bookmarklet, select it and choose the delete option.

## 5\. Useful Bookmarklet Examples

Here are a few useful bookmarklets that demonstrate the potential of JavaScript bookmarklets:

## 5.1. Readability Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet simplifies the reading experience by removing clutter from a webpage, such as ads, sidebars, and images. It focuses solely on the text, making it easier to read.

## 5.2. Page Archiver Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet saves a web page to an external service, such as Pocket or Evernote, to read later. It extracts the content and saves it for offline access.

## 5.3. Code Inspector Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet opens a code inspector tool that allows you to view and modify the code of the current web page. It's useful for debugging or understanding the underlying structure of a site.

## 6\. Advantages of Bookmarklets over Browser Extensions

While browser extensions and plugins offer similar functionality to bookmarklets, there are a few advantages to using bookmarklets:

## 6.1. Simplicity and Portability

Bookmarklets are lightweight and portable since they rely solely on JavaScript code. They can be easily shared through URLs or added to any browser without installation or compatibility issues.

## 6.2. Privacy and Performance

Since bookmarklets only execute on specific web pages when triggered, they provide more control over privacy. Additionally, bookmarklets have a minimal impact on browser performance compared to extensions, which may have additional functionality and dependencies.

## 7\. Conclusion

JavaScript bookmarklets are a powerful tool to enhance and customize your browsing experience. With a basic understanding of JavaScript and a few simple steps, you can create, edit, and use bookmarklets to automate tasks, add functionality, and save time while browsing the web. Experiment with different bookmarklets and explore the endless possibilities they offer.
