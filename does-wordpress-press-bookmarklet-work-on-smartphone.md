WordPress is one of the most popular content management systems (CMS) in the world. It allows users to create and manage their own websites with ease. One of the features that WordPress offers is Press This, a bookmarklet tool that enables users to quickly share links and content from other websites to their WordPress blogs. But does the Press This bookmarklet work on smartphones?

The Press This bookmarklet was developed to allow users to share content from other websites seamlessly. With just a single click, users can publish a link to a page or post directly from the website they are browsing, without the need to visit their WordPress dashboard. This feature is especially useful for bloggers who want to provide commentary on a specific article or share interesting content with their readers.

However, when it comes to using the Press This bookmarklet on smartphones, there are some limitations to consider. First and foremost, the availability of the Press This bookmarklet depends on the version of WordPress you are using.

For users who have self-hosted WordPress installations, the Press This bookmarklet is not available by default. Instead, they can use plugins like Press This Extended, which provides similar functionality. These plugins can be installed and activated through the WordPress dashboard, enabling users to use the Press This feature on their smartphones as well.

On the other hand, WordPress.com users have the advantage of having the Press This bookmarklet built into their platform. This means that they can access and use the bookmarklet directly from their WordPress.com dashboard, regardless of the device they are using, including smartphones.

To use the Press This bookmarklet on a smartphone, users must first make sure they have the WordPress mobile app installed. The mobile app is specifically designed to be touch-friendly, mobile optimized, and intuitive, providing an easy and seamless experience for users.

Once the app is installed, users can follow these steps to use the Press This bookmarklet:

## 1\. Open the WordPress mobile app on your smartphone.

## 2\. Navigate to the webpage you want to share.

3\. Tap on the Share icon or the Share button, depending on your device. 4. Look for the option that says "Press This" or "WordPress" and tap on it. 5. The Press This interface will open, allowing you to add commentary or make edits to the content you want to share. 6. When you are ready, tap on the "Publish" button to publish the link or post to your WordPress blog.

It's important to note that while the Press This bookmarklet works on smartphones, the user interface may differ slightly from the desktop version. The mobile version is designed to be more compact and optimized for small screens, ensuring a seamless experience for users.

Another limitation to consider is the usability of the content editing interface on smaller screens. The WordPress admin area is responsive and designed to work in mobile browsers, but the content editing interface may not provide the best user experience. On smaller screens, the responsive design may shift elements, making them less accessible.

Despite these limitations, the Press This bookmarklet can still be a valuable tool for users who want to share content on the go. Whether you are a blogger looking to provide commentary on an article or simply want to share interesting links with your audience, the Press This bookmarklet offers a convenient and efficient way to achieve this.

In conclusion, the Press This bookmarklet does work on smartphones, but its availability and functionality may vary depending on the version of WordPress you are using. Self-hosted WordPress users can install plugins like Press This Extended to access similar functionality, while WordPress.com users can use the built-in Press This bookmarklet directly from their dashboard. By using the WordPress mobile app, users can easily share content from other websites to their WordPress blogs with just a few taps on their smartphones.
