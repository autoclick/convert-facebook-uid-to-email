## Introduction:

Bookmarklets are small pieces of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks in your browser. When clicked, they execute a specific action or function on the current web page. Adding a bookmarklet to your browser allows you to easily perform tasks, automate repetitive actions, or customize your browsing experience. In this article, we will guide you through the process of adding a bookmarklet script to Google Chrome.

## Step 1: Display the Bookmark Bar

If the bookmark bar is not already visible in your Google Chrome browser, you can enable it by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + B. This action toggles the display of the bookmark bar, which is located just below the address bar.

## Step 2: Open the Bookmark Manager

To access the bookmark manager in Google Chrome, right-click on the bookmark bar. This action will bring up a dropdown menu. From the options displayed, select "Bookmark Manager". Alternatively, you can also access the bookmark manager by clicking on the three vertical dots in the top-right corner of the browser window, selecting "Bookmarks," and then choosing "Bookmark Manager."

## Step 3: Add a New Bookmark

In the bookmark manager, right-click anywhere on the page to bring up another menu. From this menu, select "Add new bookmark." A bookmark creation window will appear.

## Step 4: Give the Bookmarklet a Name

In the bookmark creation window, you will see fields for naming the bookmark and entering its URL. Give the bookmarklet a descriptive name that will help you remember its purpose.

## Step 5: Paste the Bookmarklet JavaScript Code

In the URL field, you will need to enter the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet. If you have the JavaScript code already, simply paste it into the URL field. The code should start with "javascript:" followed by the actual JavaScript code.

Note: If you do not have the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet, you will need to search for it online. Many websites offer collections of bookmarklets that you can copy and paste.

## Step 6: Save the Bookmarklet

After pasting the JavaScript code into the URL field, click "Save" to add the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar. You can now see the bookmarklet listed in the bookmark manager.

## Step 7: Using the Bookmarklet

To use the bookmarklet, simply click on it in your bookmarks bar. It will execute the JavaScript code on the current web page, performing the desired action or function.
