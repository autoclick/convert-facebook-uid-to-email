The Pepperplate app is a popular choice for individuals who enjoy cooking and organizing their favorite recipes. With its user-friendly interface and convenient features, Pepperplate allows users to save and categorize recipes from various sources. One of the key features of Pepperplate is its bookmarklet, which allows users to save recipes directly from their web browser. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to install the Pepperplate bookmarklet on iPad.

To begin the installation process, open the Safari browser on your iPad. Safari is the default browser on all iOS devices and is compatible with the Pepperplate bookmarklet.

## Step 2: Visit the Pepperplate Support Website

Type "Pepperplate Support" into the search bar. Look for the official Pepperplate support website in the search results and click on the link. Alternatively, you can directly visit the website "https://pepperplate.zendesk.com".
