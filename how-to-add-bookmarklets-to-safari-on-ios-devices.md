## Introduction

Bookmarklets are powerful tools that allow users to extend the functionality of their web browsers by executing specific JavaScript code. These mini-programs can enhance browsing experience by providing quick access to frequently performed actions, such as saving articles for offline reading or translating web pages. In this article, we will guide you through the process of adding bookmarklets to Safari on iOS devices.

## Step 1: Copy the Bookmarklet JavaScript

The first step is to obtain the JavaScript code for the desired bookmarklet. Many popular services and websites provide pre-defined bookmarklets on their websites. For instance, services like Pocket, Instapaper, and Evernote offer bookmarklets that allow you to save articles or web pages to your account.

To obtain the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet, visit the website of the service or website that provides it. Look for a page or section dedicated to bookmarklets. You often find instructions on how to add the bookmarklet to various browsers. Copy the JavaScript code to your device's clipboard.

## Step 2: Create a Regular Bookmark in Safari

Next, open Safari on your iOS device and navigate to any webpage. Tap the share icon at the bottom of the Safari toolbar. It looks like a square with an arrow pointing upwards.

In the share sheet that opens, scroll through the list of options until you find "Add Bookmark." Tap on it to create a regular bookmark.

## Step 3: Edit the Bookmark

After creating the bookmark, you need to modify it to add the bookmarklet's JavaScript code. In the bookmark editing screen, you will see various fields to customize the bookmark. Update the fields as follows:

\- Name: Give your bookmark a descriptive name that identifies its purpose. - Address: Clear the existing URL in the field and paste the JavaScript code you copied earlier. Make sure the JavaScript code is valid and complete.

## Step 4: Save the Bookmarklet

Once you have added the JavaScript code, tap "Save" to save the bookmarklet to Safari. The bookmarklet will now appear in your bookmark list within Safari.

## Step 5: Access the Bookmarklet

To access the bookmarklet, open any webpage in Safari, and tap the bookmarks icon at the bottom of the screen. It looks like an open book. In the bookmark list that appears, find the bookmarklet you just created and tap on it.

The bookmarklet will execute the JavaScript code, performing the desired action on the current webpage. For example, if you added a bookmarklet from a service like Pocket, tapping on it will save the current webpage to your Pocket account.

## Conclusion

By following these simple steps, you can easily add bookmarklets to Safari on your iOS device. Bookmarklets allow you to extend Safari's functionality and perform useful actions with just a tap. Whether it's saving articles for later, translating web pages, or any other action provided by the available bookmarklets, this process empowers you to customize your browsing experience.
