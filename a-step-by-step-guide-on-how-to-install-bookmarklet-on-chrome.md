## Introduction

Bookmarklets are small pieces of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks in your web browser and used to perform specific actions on a web page. They are a convenient way to add functionality to your browser without the need for installing extensions or plugins. In this guide, we will walk you through the steps to install bookmarklets on Google Chrome.

## Step 1: Enable the Bookmark Bar (if not already enabled)

By default, the bookmark bar is hidden in Chrome. To enable it, follow these steps:

## 1\. Open Google Chrome on your computer.

2\. Go to the top-right corner of the browser window and click on the three-dot menu icon. 3. From the dropdown menu, hover over "Bookmarks" and then click on "Show bookmarks bar".

## Step 2: Access the Bookmark Manager

The Bookmark Manager in Chrome allows you to organize and manage your bookmarks. To access it, follow these steps:

1\. Right-click anywhere on the bookmark bar (empty space) to bring up a dropdown menu. 2. From the dropdown menu, click on "Bookmark Manager". Alternatively, you can press "Ctrl+Shift+O" (Windows) or "Command+Shift+O" (Mac) as a shortcut.

## Step 3: Create a New Bookmark

In the Bookmark Manager, you will be able to create a new bookmark and add the bookmarklet code. Follow these steps:

1\. In the Bookmark Manager, right-click anywhere on the list of bookmarks to bring up another dropdown menu.

## 2\. From the dropdown menu, click on "Add new bookmark".

## Step 4: Name the Bookmarklet

A dialog box will appear asking you to provide a name for the bookmarklet. Enter a descriptive name that will help you identify its purpose easily.

## Step 5: Add the JavaScript Code

In the URL field of the dialog box, you will need to add the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet. The code must be prefixed with "javascript:".

You can obtain the bookmarklet code from various sources such as websites, blogs, or bookmarklet generators. Some popular bookmarklet examples include:

## \- Instapaper: Allows you to save articles for later reading.

## \- Pocket: Saves web pages to your Pocket account for offline reading.

## \- Grammarly: Checks grammar and spelling on any webpage.

## To add the bookmarklet code, follow these steps:

## 1\. Paste the bookmarklet code in the URL field.

## Note: Make sure that the code is prefixed with "javascript:".

## 2\. Click on the "Save" button to save the bookmarklet.

## Step 6: Using the Bookmarklet

Once the bookmarklet is saved, you can use it on any webpage by simply clicking on the bookmarklet in the bookmark bar. The bookmarklet will execute the JavaScript code and perform the desired action on the webpage.
