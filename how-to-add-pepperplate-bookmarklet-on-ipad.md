Bookmarklets are a handy tool that allows users to quickly access and utilize specific functionalities or features of a website. However, on an iPad, bookmarklets are not well-supported in the default Safari browser. This article will provide a workaround solution for iPad users who want to add the Pepperplate bookmarklet to their device.

Pepperplate is a popular app and website that helps users organize and manage their recipes. The Pepperplate bookmarklet allows users to quickly save recipes from any webpage with just a click. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the iPad's Safari browser, adding bookmarklets directly is not possible. However, there is a workaround that involves using alternative browsers and bookmarking methods.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to add Pepperplate Bookmarklet on iPad:

1\. Install an alternative browser: Since Safari on iPad does not support bookmarklets, you will need to use a different browser that allows for this functionality. Two popular alternatives are Google Chrome and Firefox, both of which can be downloaded for free from the App Store.

2\. Open Bookmarks in the alternative browser: Once you have installed the alternative browser, open it on your iPad. Locate the bookmarks feature within the browser. In Google Chrome, tap the three dots at the bottom right and select "Bookmarks." In Firefox, tap the menu button at the bottom of the screen and select "Bookmarks."

3\. Create a new bookmark: To add the Pepperplate bookmarklet, you will need to create a new bookmark. Open any website within the alternative browser and tap the share icon (usually represented by a box with an arrow pointing up). Then, select the option to add a bookmark. This will create a new bookmark with the URL of the current webpage.

4\. Edit the bookmark properties: After creating the bookmark, you will need to edit its properties. Tap on the bookmark you just created, and a dialog box should appear. Rename the bookmark to something like "Pepperplate" or "Save to Pepperplate." Additionally, you will need to replace the URL of the bookmark with the Pepperplate bookmarklet code.

5\. Obtain the Pepperplate bookmarklet code: To get the Pepperplate bookmarklet code, you can visit the official Pepperplate support website or check out tutorial videos on platforms like Vimeo or YouTube. The bookmarklet code typically looks like a short snippet of JavaScript. Copy the code to your device's clipboard.

6\. Replace the URL with the bookmarklet code: Within the bookmark properties dialog box, delete the existing URL and paste the bookmarklet code that you copied in the previous step. Make sure the entire code is entered correctly and without any additional spaces or characters.

7\. Save the bookmark changes: Once you have replaced the URL with the bookmarklet code, tap the "Save" or "Done" button to save the changes to the bookmark. The bookmark should now have the Pepperplate bookmarklet code as its URL.

8\. Access the bookmarklet: You can now access the Pepperplate bookmarklet from your bookmarks within the alternative browser. Whenever you come across a recipe or webpage you want to save to Pepperplate, simply open the bookmarks feature, select the Pepperplate bookmarklet, and it will execute the code to save the recipe to your Pepperplate account.

It's important to note that while this workaround provides a solution for adding the Pepperplate bookmarklet on iPad, it may not work perfectly in all cases due to compatibility issues between the alternative browser and certain websites. However, in most instances, this method should allow you to utilize the Pepperplate bookmarklet on your iPad.

In conclusion, adding the Pepperplate bookmarklet on an iPad can be achieved by using an alternative browser that supports bookmarklets. By following the steps outlined in this guide, iPad users can save recipes to their Pepperplate account with ease. Remember to always keep your alternative browser up to date for optimal performance and compatibility.
