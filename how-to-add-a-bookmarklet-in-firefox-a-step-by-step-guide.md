## Introduction:

Bookmarklets are powerful tools that allow you to automate tasks and enhance your browsing experience in Firefox. They are browser bookmarks containing snippets of JavaScript code, offering more functionality than regular bookmarks. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of adding a bookmarklet to Firefox, both through the toolbar and manually.

## Step 1: Show the Bookmarks Toolbar

The first step is to show the bookmarks toolbar. Press Ctrl+Shift+B to open the Bookmarks library. Alternatively, you can right-click on the toolbar area and select "Bookmarks Toolbar" from the context menu. By enabling the bookmarks toolbar, you will have quick access to your bookmarked sites and bookmarklets.

## Step 2: Add a Bookmarklet from a Website

To add a bookmarklet from a website, visit the webpage that provides the bookmarklet. Once you're on the page, locate the bookmarklet link. This link is typically labeled as "Bookmarklet" or "Add to Firefox." Click and drag the bookmarklet link to the bookmarks toolbar. You will see a visual indicator as you drag the link.

## Step 3: Verify the Bookmarklet

After dropping the bookmarklet link onto the bookmarks toolbar, the bookmarklet will be installed. To verify it, simply click on the bookmarklet on the toolbar. The bookmarklet will execute its JavaScript code, performing the desired action on the current webpage.

## Step 4: Add a Bookmarklet Manually

If you don't have a bookmarklet link available or prefer to add a bookmarklet manually, follow these steps:

## 1\. Right-click on the bookmarks toolbar and select "New Bookmark."

2\. In the "Name" field, provide a descriptive name for the bookmarklet. 3. In the "Location" field, enter the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet.

## 4\. Click "Add" to save the bookmarklet.

To add a bookmarklet manually, you need to know the JavaScript code that defines its functionality. You can find bookmarklet code on websites or create your own.

## Step 5: Editing or Deleting a Bookmarklet

To edit or delete a bookmarklet, right-click on it in the bookmarks toolbar and choose the appropriate option. If you want to modify the JavaScript code, choose "Properties" and edit the code in the "Location" field. To remove the bookmarklet, select "Delete."
