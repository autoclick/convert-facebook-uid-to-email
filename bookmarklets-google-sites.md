Google Sites is a website creation platform provided by Google that allows users to create and publish websites easily without extensive coding knowledge. It provides templates and tools for users to customize their websites and add various functionalities.

One of the features available on Google Sites is the use of bookmarklets. Bookmarklets are bookmarks that contain JavaScript code and can be executed in the browser. They are useful for adding additional functionality to websites and performing specific tasks with a single click.

To install a bookmarklet on Google Sites, you need to first find or create a bookmarklet script. These scripts are usually provided by third-party developers or can be written by yourself if you have programming knowledge. Once you have the script ready, follow these steps to install the bookmarklet:

## 1\. Go to your Google Sites website editor.

2\. Add a new text box or a custom HTML box to the page where you want to install the bookmarklet.

## 3\. Click on the "Insert" menu and select "Embed".

## 4\. In the Embed dialog box, choose the option to embed a link.

## 5\. Enter a name for the bookmarklet.

## 6\. In the "Link" field, enter the JavaScript code for the bookmarklet.

## 7\. Click "Apply" to save the changes.

## 8\. Preview or publish the page to see the bookmarklet in action.

The bookmarklet will now appear as a clickable link on your Google Sites page. When clicked, it will execute the JavaScript code and perform the desired action.

There are various types of bookmarklets that you can use on Google Sites to enhance the functionality of your website. Some popular bookmarklets include:

1\. YouTube Bypass: This bookmarklet allows you to bypass age or country restrictions on YouTube videos. It modifies the URL of the video page to enable uninterrupted playback.

By using bookmarklets on Google Sites, you can add these additional functionalities to your website without requiring complex coding or plugin installations. They provide a convenient way to enhance user experience and improve website productivity.

In addition to Google Sites, bookmarklets can be used on other website platforms and browsers as well. They are versatile tools that can be customized to suit specific needs and can greatly enhance the browsing experience for both website owners and visitors.
