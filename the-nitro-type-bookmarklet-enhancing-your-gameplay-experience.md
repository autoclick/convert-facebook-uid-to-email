While the game itself provides an enjoyable experience, there are always ways to enhance and streamline gameplay. This article introduces the Nitro Type Bookmarklet, a tool that can be used to add or remove garage sections in the game.

## What is Nitro Type?

Nitro Type is essentially a typing game that combines elements of racing and competition. Users race against each other by typing out a given passage as quickly and accurately as possible. The game utilizes a real-time input system, allowing players to see the progress of their opponents and adjust their typing accordingly. It provides an engaging and interactive platform for individuals to improve their typing skills while having fun.

## How does the Nitro Type Bookmarklet work?

The Nitro Type Bookmarklet is a simple yet powerful tool that allows players to modify their garage sections in Nitro Type. Normally, players are limited to a certain number of garage sections, which can restrict their customization options. The Bookmarklet bypasses this restriction by adding or removing garage sections, thereby providing more freedom to the players.

## To use the Nitro Type Bookmarklet, users need to follow these steps:

1\. Install the Bookmarklet: Users can find the Nitro Type Bookmarklet on GitHub and install it in their browser. It is available as a JavaScript file, which can be easily added to the bookmarks toolbar.

2\. Access Nitro Type: Users should navigate to the Nitro Type website and log in to their account.

3\. Activate the Bookmarklet: Once logged in, users can click on the Nitro Type Bookmarklet in their bookmarks toolbar. This will prompt a pop-up window where they can enter the desired number of garage sections.

4\. Apply the Changes: After specifying the number of garage sections, users need to log out of their Nitro Type account and then log back in. This will enable them to see the changes reflected in their garage sections.

## Benefits of using the Nitro Type Bookmarklet:

## The Nitro Type Bookmarklet offers several benefits to players:

1\. Enhanced Customization: By adding or removing garage sections, players have more control over their customization options. They can increase the number of cars they can own and display, allowing for greater personalization and diversity in their garage.

2\. Flexibility: The Bookmarklet addresses the limitation of the default number of garage sections by providing players with a way to expand or streamline their collections. This flexibility allows users to adapt their garage based on their specific preferences and needs.

## Limitations and considerations:

While the Nitro Type Bookmarklet offers many advantages, there are a few limitations and considerations to keep in mind:

1\. Caution with Modifications: Players should exercise caution when modifying their garage sections. Making excessive changes or going beyond the game's intended limits may lead to technical issues or even consequences from the game's administrators. It is important to use the Bookmarklet responsibly and within the bounds of fair gameplay.

2\. Compatibility: The Nitro Type Bookmarklet works with most modern browsers, but users should ensure that their browser and operating system are up to date for optimal performance.

3\. Third-Party Software: The Bookmarklet itself is a third-party tool developed by community members and not officially endorsed by the creators of Nitro Type. Players should be aware of the risks associated with using third-party software and exercise caution when installing and using the tool.

4\. Loss of Progress: Modifying garage sections can result in the loss of progress or changes made to cars. Players should make a backup of their garage or take note of their current settings before applying changes.

## Conclusion:

By bypassing the limitations of the default garage sections, players can explore new car combinations, enhance their gameplay experience, and engage in creative customization options.
