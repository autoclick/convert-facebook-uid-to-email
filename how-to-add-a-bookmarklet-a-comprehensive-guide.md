Bookmarklets are powerful tools that allow you to add customized functionality to your web browser. By simply clicking on a bookmarklet, you can perform a variety of tasks on any webpage, from quickly searching for a selected text to adding items to your favorite online service. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of adding bookmarklets to your browser, step by step.

## Step 1: Copy the Bookmarklet's Code or Link Address

The first step is to obtain the bookmarklet's code or link address. Bookmarklets can be found on various websites, and they are often accompanied by a small icon or button labeled "Add Bookmarklet" or similar. Once you have located a bookmarklet you would like to add, right-click on the button or icon and select "Copy Link Address" or "Copy Code" depending on the bookmarklet's format.

## Step 2: Open Your Browser's Bookmarks Bar or Bookmark Manager

Next, you will need to access your browser's bookmarks bar or bookmark manager. The location and appearance of these features may vary depending on the browser you are using. In most browsers, you can access the bookmarks bar by right-clicking on an empty space near the top of the browser window and selecting "Show Bookmarks Bar." You can also open the bookmark manager by selecting "Bookmarks" from the browser's menu and choosing "Bookmark Manager."

## Step 3: Add a New Bookmark and Paste the Link Code or Address

Once you have opened the bookmarks bar or bookmark manager, you can proceed to add a new bookmark. In the bookmark manager, there is typically a button or menu option labeled "Add Bookmark" or "New Bookmark." Click on this button to create a new bookmark. In the bookmarks bar, you can simply right-click on an empty space within the bar and select "Add Page" or "New Bookmark."

After opening the bookmark creation dialog, you will need to paste the bookmarklet's code or link address into the appropriate field. To do this, right-click within the URL or Address field and select "Paste" from the context menu. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl + V" (Windows) or "Cmd + V" (Mac) to paste the code or address.

## Step 4: Name the Bookmark and Save It

To ensure that you can easily identify and access the bookmarklet, it is important to give it a descriptive name. In the bookmark creation dialog, locate the field labeled "Name" or "Title." Click on this field and enter a name that clearly describes the functionality of the bookmarklet. Once you have named the bookmark, click on the "Save" or "Add" button to save it.

## Step 5: Run the Bookmarklet by Loading Bookmarks Normally

Now that you have added the bookmarklet to your browser, you can run it by loading your bookmarks normally. To do this, simply click on the bookmarks bar or open the bookmark manager and locate the bookmarklet you added. Clicking on the bookmarklet will activate its functionality, allowing you to perform the desired action on the current webpage.

## How to Edit a Bookmarklet

If you need to make changes to a bookmarklet, such as updating its functionality or modifying its name, you can easily do so by editing the bookmark. Access your browser's bookmark manager, locate the bookmarklet you wish to edit, and right-click on it. In the context menu, select "Edit" or "Properties." This will open a dialog where you can make the necessary changes. Once you have finished editing the bookmarklet, click on the "Save" or "Update" button to apply the changes.

## How to Share a Bookmarklet

Sharing bookmarklets with others is simple. Once you have added a bookmarklet to your browser, you can share it by providing the code or link address to others. They can then follow the same steps outlined in this guide to add the bookmarklet to their own browser. Additionally, some websites and services offer pre-made bookmarklet links that can be easily shared and added by simply clicking on them.
