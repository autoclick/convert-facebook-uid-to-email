Another option is to use a bookmarklet to send a webpage via email. A bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that is saved as a bookmark in your web browser. When clicked, the bookmarklet performs a specific action or function on the webpage you are currently viewing. In this case, we will use a bookmarklet to send the webpage via email.

To use a bookmarklet, you need to first create it and add it to your bookmarks toolbar or bookmarks menu. Here's how you can do it:

1\. Go to the EmailThis bookmarklet site (emailthis.me) on your web browser. 2. Drag and drop the "Email This" button to your bookmarks toolbar or bookmarks menu. This will create a bookmarklet. 3. Once the bookmarklet is added, whenever you come across a webpage that you want to send via email, simply click on the "Email This" bookmarklet.

## 4\. The webpage will load, save, and be sent to your inbox as an email.

The EmailThis bookmarklet is a convenient way to send webpages via email. It saves you the hassle of manually copying and pasting the webpage content into an email. With just a single click, the webpage is saved and sent to your inbox.

One advantage of using a bookmarklet to send webpages via email is that it allows you to easily send a webpage to multiple recipients. Simply enter the email addresses of the recipients in the email composer, and the webpage will be sent to all of them.

Furthermore, bookmarklets can be customized to suit your needs. If you have a preferred email client or service, you can modify the bookmarklet to send webpages via your chosen email tool. This way, you have more control over the email sending process and can use the email client of your choice.

Using a bookmarklet to send webpages via email has several benefits. Firstly, it allows you to easily share interesting articles, blog posts, or websites with others. Instead of just sending a link, you can send the entire webpage as it appears, ensuring that the recipient gets the full context and content.

Secondly, sending a webpage via email allows the recipient to read the content offline. This is especially useful when the recipient doesn't have internet access or wants to read the page later without the distractions of the web.

Lastly, sending webpages via email is a great way to archive and organize information. By keeping a copy of the webpage in your inbox, you can easily access it later for reference, without the need to search for it again.

In conclusion, sending webpages via email can be easily done using bookmarklets. With just a few simple steps, you can add the EmailThis bookmarklet to your browser and start sending webpages via email with a single click. This method saves you time and effort, allowing you to share, save, and organize webpages efficiently. Give it a try and experience the convenience of sending webpages via email.
