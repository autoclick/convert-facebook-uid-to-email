Bookmarklets are small pieces of JavaScript code that can be saved as bookmarks in your web browser. These bookmarklets can then be executed when you visit a specific website, allowing you to automate certain tasks or enhance your browsing experience.

While adding bookmarklets on a desktop browser like Google Chrome is straightforward, adding them on an Android device can be a bit more challenging. However, with a few simple steps, you can add bookmarklets to your Android device's browser and enjoy the same functionality as on your desktop.

In this article, we will guide you on how to add bookmarklets on Android using the Google Chrome browser. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Step 1: Install Google Chrome

Make sure you have the Google Chrome app installed on your Android device. If it is not already installed, you can download it from the Google Play Store.

## Step 2: Open Google Chrome

Once you have installed Google Chrome, open the app on your Android device.

## Step 3: Visit a Website

Go to the website where you want to add a bookmarklet. This could be a website that provides bookmarklet code or a website where you want to use a bookmarklet.

## Step 4: Copy the Bookmarklet Code

Next, you need to copy the bookmarklet code. Bookmarklet code is usually provided as a piece of JavaScript within a link or button on a website. When clicked, this code will be executed.

To copy the bookmarklet code, you can tap and hold on the link or button that contains the code. You should see a context menu with various options. Select the "Copy" option to copy the bookmarklet code to your device's clipboard.

## Step 5: Create a New Bookmark

After copying the bookmarklet code, go back to the website where you want to add the bookmarklet and tap on the menu icon (three dots) in the top-right corner of the Chrome browser. Then, tap on the "Bookmarks" option in the menu.

In the Bookmarks section, tap on the folder where you want to save the bookmarklet or create a new folder by tapping on the "+ New folder" option. Once you have selected the folder, tap on the "+ Add" button to create a new bookmark.

## Step 6: Edit the New Bookmark

In the bookmark editing screen, you will see various options such as the bookmark name and the URL. By default, the URL field will be populated with the URL of the website you were on when you created the bookmark.

However, since we want to add a bookmarklet, we need to replace the URL with the bookmarklet code we copied earlier. To do this, tap on the URL field and paste the bookmarklet code from your device's clipboard. You can do this by tapping and holding on the field and selecting the "Paste" option.

## Step 7: Save the Bookmark

Once you have pasted the bookmarklet code into the URL field, tap on the "Save" button to save the bookmark. The bookmarklet will now be added to your bookmarks folder.

## Step 8: Access and Execute the Bookmarklet

To access and execute the bookmarklet, open the Chrome browser and go to the website where you want to use the bookmarklet. Then, tap on the menu icon (three dots) in the top-right corner of the browser and select the "Bookmarks" option.

Navigate to the folder where you saved the bookmarklet and tap on it. The bookmarklet code will now be executed, and you will see the desired action or enhancement take effect on the website.

## Conclusion

Adding bookmarklets to your Android device's browser, such as Google Chrome, can be a useful way to automate tasks or enhance your browsing experience. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can easily add bookmarklets and enjoy their functionality on your Android device.

Remember to copy the bookmarklet code from a trusted source, as executing unknown or malicious code can pose a security risk.

However, many bookmarklets are compatible with mobile browsers and can add valuable functionality to your browsing experience.
