Pinterest is a popular social media platform that allows users to discover and save ideas for various interests. One of the key features of Pinterest is the ability to "pin" content to boards, which act as virtual inspiration boards. While you can easily pin content from within the Pinterest platform, there are times when you may come across something interesting while browsing the web and want to save it to your Pinterest boards. This is where a Pinterest bookmarklet comes in handy.

A bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code that is saved as a bookmark in your web browser. When clicked, it performs a specific function on the webpage you are currently viewing. In the case of a Pinterest bookmarklet, it allows you to quickly and easily pin images or content to your Pinterest boards without having to navigate to the Pinterest website.

Creating a Pinterest bookmarklet is a simple process. Let's walk through the steps.

## Step 1: Go to the Pinterest Goodies page

The first step is to visit the Pinterest Goodies page. You can do this by typing "Pinterest Goodies" into your search engine or by directly typing "https://www.pinterest.com/goodies/" into your web browser's address bar. This page contains various tools and widgets provided by Pinterest, including the "Pin It" button.

## Step 2: Drag the "Pin It" button to your browser toolbar

Once you are on the Pinterest Goodies page, look for the "Pin It" button. It is usually located towards the top of the page. To add it to your browser toolbar, simply click and hold the button, then drag it to your preferred location on the toolbar.

## Step 3: Drop the "Pin It" button onto your Favorites or Bookmarks bar

After dragging the "Pin It" button to your browser toolbar, you will see a prompt asking you to drop it onto your Favorites or Bookmarks bar. The exact wording may vary depending on your web browser. Release the button and it will be added to your bar.

## Step 4: Follow the prompts to complete the installation

To complete the installation of the Pinterest bookmarklet, follow any prompts that appear on your screen. These prompts may include instructions for customizing the bookmarklet or confirming that you want to add it to your browser.

That's it! You have successfully created a Pinterest bookmarklet. Now, whenever you come across something you want to pin to one of your Pinterest boards while browsing the web, simply click on the "Pin It" button on your browser toolbar.

When you click the "Pin It" button, a window will pop up with a selection of images from the webpage you are currently on. You can choose the image you want to pin, add a description or caption, and select the board you want to save it to. Once you have made your selections, click the "Pin" button to add it to your Pinterest account.

In addition to the basic Pinterest bookmarklet, there are also other useful bookmarklets available that enhance your Pinterest experience. Here are a few examples:

1\. Pinterest Image Pinner: This bookmarklet allows you to pin any image on a webpage by simply right-clicking on it and selecting the "Pin Image" option.

2\. Pinterest Text Pinner: This bookmarklet allows you to pin selected text from a webpage. Just highlight the text you want to pin, right-click, and choose the "Pin Text" option.

3\. Pinterest Page Pinner: This bookmarklet enables you to pin an entire webpage. Click on the bookmarklet while on a webpage, and it will generate a pin with a screenshot of the page and a description.

To install these bookmarklets, you can simply drag and drop them onto your browser toolbar, following the same steps as mentioned earlier.

In conclusion, creating a Pinterest bookmarklet is a simple process that allows you to easily pin content from any webpage to your Pinterest boards. By following the steps outlined above, you can start saving and organizing your favorite web finds in no time. Happy pinning!
