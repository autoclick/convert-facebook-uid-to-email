Adding a bookmarklet in Safari on iOS can be a useful way to quickly access and use web-based tools and services. Bookmarklets are bookmarks that contain JavaScript code, allowing them to perform specific actions on a webpage when clicked.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add a bookmarklet in Safari on iOS:

## Step 1: Copy the Javascript code

First, you need to obtain the Javascript code for the bookmarklet you want to add. Many websites and web services provide bookmarklet instructions along with the necessary code.

To copy the Javascript code, open the website or service page that offers the bookmarklet. Look for the link or button that says something like "Bookmarklet" or "Add to Safari." Click on it, and you'll be presented with a pop-up window that displays the Javascript code. Select and copy this code to your clipboard.

## Step 2: Create a new bookmark

Next, open Safari on your iOS device and navigate to any webpage. Tap on the share button, which is usually represented by a square with an arrow pointing upward. This will open the sharing options menu.

In the sharing options menu, scroll horizontally until you see the "Add Bookmark" option. Tap on it, and a new window will appear.

## Step 3: Edit the bookmark

In the new window, you'll see fields for the bookmark title and URL. Edit the title to something that identifies the bookmarklet, like "Bookmarklet - \[name of the tool or service\]."

Next, delete the URL in the URL field and paste the Javascript code that you copied earlier. Make sure there are no extra spaces or characters added during the paste process.

## Step 4: Choose the bookmark location

Safari gives you the option to choose where to save the bookmark. You can save it in the default "Favorites" folder or create a new folder specifically for bookmarklets.

To create a new folder, tap on the "Location" dropdown menu. At the bottom of the list, you will see an option to "Edit" the bookmark locations. Tap on "Edit," and a new window will appear.

In the new window, tap on the "New Folder" button. Give the folder a name, such as "Bookmarklets." Tap "Done" when finished.

Now, go back to the "Location" dropdown menu, and you'll see your newly created folder. Select it as the location for your bookmarklet.

## Step 5: Save the bookmark

## Finally, tap on the "Save" button to save your bookmarklet.

You have now successfully added a bookmarklet in Safari on iOS. The bookmarklet will be accessible from your bookmarks list and can be used on any webpage you visit.

To use the bookmarklet, simply open Safari, tap on the bookmarks icon (represented by a book icon at the bottom of the screen), and navigate to the folder where you saved the bookmarklet. Tap on the bookmarklet, and it will execute its designated action on the current webpage.

Remember that bookmarklets are essentially blocks of code that can interact with webpages, so it's important to only add bookmarklets from trusted sources. Be cautious when using bookmarklets, as they can potentially collect data or perform actions without your explicit consent.

In conclusion, adding a bookmarklet in Safari on iOS is a convenient way to enhance your web browsing experience and access useful tools and services with a single tap. Follow the steps outlined above, and you'll be able to make the most out of bookmarklets on your iOS device.
