## Introduction:

Gimkit is an educational platform that allows teachers to create interactive quizzes and assignments for their students. While it is designed to promote learning and engagement, some individuals have found ways to cheat on Gimkit by using hacks and bots. One popular cheat method is the Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet, a tool that saves answers and displays them with a click of a button. In this article, we will explore how to use this bookmarklet, its potential features, and the controversy surrounding cheating in educational settings.

## How to Use the Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet:

## To use the Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet, follow these steps:

1\. Create a new bookmark in your browser: Open your browser and navigate to the bookmarks section. Create a new bookmark by clicking on the "Bookmark" or "Add Bookmark" option.

2\. Change the URL to the code provided in Bookmarklet.txt: Open the code file called "Bookmarklet.txt" and copy the code. Edit the URL of the bookmark you created in step 1 and paste the code as the new URL.

3\. Save the bookmark: Click the "Save" or "Done" button to save the bookmark with the updated code.

4\. Access an active Gimkit game: Open Gimkit and join an active game. The bookmarklet will only work when there is an ongoing game to cheat on.

5\. Activate the bookmarklet: During the game, click on the bookmarklet you created. This will activate the cheat and save the answers for each question.

6\. Display the saved answers: To see the saved answers, click on the bookmarklet again. The saved answers will be displayed on the screen, indicating which ones were previously selected and if they were correct or incorrect.

## Color Meaning:

The Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet uses colors to indicate the status of the answers:

1\. Green: If an answer choice appears green, it means that the user has chosen it before and it was correct.

2\. Red: If an answer choice appears red, it means that the user has chosen it before and it was incorrect.

## Potential Future Features:

The Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet has the potential to include additional features in the future. Some of the possible features that developers may consider are:

1\. Function for text response answers: Currently, the bookmarklet only saves and displays multiple-choice answers. Adding support for text response answers would enhance its cheating capabilities.

2\. Export and import data: The ability to export saved answers and import them into different games or devices would provide users with more flexibility in their cheating strategies.

## Controversy Surrounding Cheating:

Using hacks and bots, such as the Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet, to cheat in educational settings raises ethical and academic integrity concerns. Cheating undermines the purpose of assessments and can harm the learning environment for all students involved. It can also have negative consequences for the cheaters themselves, as it prevents them from acquiring the knowledge and skills they are supposed to learn.

Educators and educational platforms like Gimkit are continuously working to combat cheating by implementing measures to prevent or detect cheating attempts. This includes monitoring student activity, using anti-cheating software, and educating students about the importance of academic integrity.

## Conclusion:

The Gimkit Hack Bookmarklet is a cheat tool designed to provide an easy way to cheat on Gimkit quizzes. By saving and displaying answers with a click of a button, users can gain an unfair advantage over their peers. However, cheating in educational settings raises ethical concerns and undermines the purpose of assessments. It is crucial for educators and students alike to prioritize academic integrity and engage in fair learning practices.
